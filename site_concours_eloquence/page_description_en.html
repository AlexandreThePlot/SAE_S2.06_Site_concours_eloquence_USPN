				<h1>What is a "speech contest"?</h1>
				
				<p>
					<!--Peut etre faire un truc "1 orateur, 1 sujet, 1 scène, 1 public"-->
					First of all, it is necessary to look at what eloquence is. It is an art of oratory, 
					a mastery of rhetoric, an attitude of expressing oneself in an easy way in front of an audience, 
					by appealing to both emotions and argumentation. <br><br>
					
					On one hand, the speaker is able to persuade 
					thanks to a well-constructed argument, which he or she will have prepared and organized. <br><br>
					
					On the other hand, the speaker will use communication codes, such as gestures, 
					voice tone variation and looking at their audience, to convince the audience. <br><br>
					 
					The speaker is invited to speak with his or her own words and personality, 
					and to make sure that they do not exaggerate. <br><br>
					
					The eloquence competition is therefore intended to evaluate the candidate's ability to 
					mobilise oratory techniques to leave a lasting impression on the audience.

				<h1>What does it consist of?</h1>
				
				<p>
					Candidates put forward their thoughts and ideas on a specific topic 
					chosen by the jury beforehand, in front of them and the audience.<br><br>

					The order of appearance is drawn by lot in order to ensure fairness between the candidates.<br><br>

					Ideally, the speech should last between 10 and 15 minutes, 
					during which time the candidates will be judged on the quality of their argument, 
					their strength of conviction, the dynamism and the tone of their speech. <br><br>

					After all the candidates have spoken, 
					the jury will decide on the winners of the competition with the support of the public.

				<div id="avantages">
					<div id="avantage1">
						<h2>An improvement in your oral skills</h2>

						<p>
							It goes without saying that you will drastically 
							improve your oratory skills: a varied intonation,
							 a carrying voice, expressive gestures. 
							These are very useful tools that will help you 
							to capture the attention of your audience and 
							make what you say much more interesting, but also to
							 add feelings adapted to the message you want to convey.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="avantage2">
						<h2>Better self-confidence</h2>

						<p>
							<!--
							Se surpasser en vainquant son stress face à un public, être fier de son discours,
							des atouts qui vous aideront réellement dans votre vie personnelle et professionelle.
							-->
							You are always looking to improve your self-confidence. 
							This exercise is for you. 
							It will allow you to surpass yourself 
							by overcoming your stress in front of an audience, 
							being proud of the ideas you advocate and 
							the message you convey. 
							All these steps will be assets that 
							will really help you in your personal 
							and professional life.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="avantage3">
						<h2>A valuable asset for your resume</h2>

						<p>
							Another important advantage is that simply

							contest shows your ambition and determination to 
							take the plunge and that you are not afraid to walk
							 in unfamiliar territory, which is highly apprecia
							ted in the professional world.
